==================
Introducing Arrow
==================
Arrow is a test framework designed to promote test-driven JavaScript development. Arrow provides a consistent test creation and execution environment for both JavaScript developers and quality engineers.

Arrow erases the line between Development's unit tests and Quality engineering's functional and integration tests. Arrow provides a uniform way to create and execute all type of tests, so the purpose of the test no longer dictates how it is created and/or executed. 

Arrow enables you to:

* Create unit tests to validate specific units of JavaScript code
* Create pre-commit functional tests against mock pages
* Reuse the tests in post-commit scenarios
* Create cross-page test scenarios
